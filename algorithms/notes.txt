

on n = 20 
greedy: 19 15 10 20 16 14 12 18 (86 to 124)

perlmutter:
(divisors?)
a1 = 19
a2 = 
a3
a4
a5 = 15? 
a6 = 12
a7 = 14
a8 = 16
a9 = 18
a10 = 20
so perlmutter just misses 10? 

(perlmutter rule: ak is the largest multple of k in the upper half of the pot which has no facotrs? divisors? bigger than k)


approx num picks (greedy):
>10 @ 30ish
>100 @ 300
>200 @ 600
>300 @ 900

(random q: determine relationship between n and num picks?)
