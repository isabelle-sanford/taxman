Website work
- Connect js to backend calculation/gamestate stuff (?)
- Redo how factors are calculated / stored (see pinned message in chat w/ B)
- Make prettier
- Track player/taxman scores
- implement move history and possibly the ability to undo/go back to any past move

Algorithm/testing work
- Implement improved greedy algorithm
- Implement Perlmutter method
- Implement Hensley method (or try)
- Brute force optimal sequences
- Optional: have each number store only the list of elements with exactly one of its prime factors missing, and recurse down through those numbers when taxing

Reading/sources work
- Figure out why we know optimal score but not sequence
- Read updated Moniot paper
- Read papers on OEIS page

Paper/writing work
- Flesh out 'first prime pick' section with Moniot's logic
- Add example play for each given strategy (with pictures?)
- Add initial example of play / improve it
- Add how Hensley gets concrete/numerical upper & lower bounds
- do a proper bibliography
- change n to N?
- format sidebars/subsections to be clearer

Other
- Can I include the paper sources as PDFs? Copyright?
- Update/improve README
- PDFs - do they need zone identifiers? what are those?

Future/stretch goals
- write paper as website, with all algebra in dropdown tabs so you can choose difficulty/how step-by-step it is
- Take algorithm test outcomes and turn into a set of graphs showing their relative performance
    - scatter/line plot, x axis is pot size, y axis is score, color is algorithm, maybe hovering shows sequence
    - selecting a particular number shows sequence, score, and bar chart for each algorithm (available in spolier box at bottom of play page, for easy reference)
