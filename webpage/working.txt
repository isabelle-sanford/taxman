Features
- Track player/taxman scores

Refactoring
- Track availability with the multiples/score/decrement idea
(Each number contains a list of its multiples and a score representing how many numbers it is a multiple of; when a number is picked each multiple's score is decremented by 1, a number is unavailable if its score is 0)
- Figure out how to do some coloring with css and on:hover(?)

Appearance
- Center table/etc on the page, or at least add margin

Bugs/problems
- table isn't evenly spaced?
- make hitting enter on the form work
- need to check for newly-unavailable numbers (do multiples thing above)


Later features
- connect to go backend logic (?)
- figure out how to store/calculate divisors efficiently
- make prettier
- Make table row length variable below a certain screen size
- add move history
